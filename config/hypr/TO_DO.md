To Do list
- upload to git dotfiles, so its saved
  - Also ideally adjust dotfiles to only be dotfiles and include P10k (update to use gnu stow instead of symlinks
  - create separate repos like JaKoolITs for each distro with a oneliner curl line (like titus) to download script and run it which should install all the necessary things and then end with applying the dotfiles


To Do hyprland configs
- Add window rule to make terminals slightly more transparent but add a blur
- Allow for custom wallpaper
- Finalize wallust
  - Install
  - finalize each config
  - Adding Lights (keyboard, ram, mobo and fans, GoXLR if possible)
  - finalize the initial script I made to update all current theme/timing the reloads
- Extract out the keybinds and source them in the config
- create a parse to convert the keybinds into a help window (rofi?, see JKI for inspiration)
- create a search bar for wallpapers, and themes to mimic JKI, wallpapers for sure other tbd.
- Incorporate some of JKI waybar config, the theming in particular
- change nautalis theme to dark
- hyprlock to have a blur that shows the backgroud
  - advance have it undo the blur at an angle or even mimic the swww
- Adapt the scripts to be in there own space? Or should they stay in hypr? I guess I have to think if I ever want to just use them or if they are all exclusively to be used by 
- also would be nice to have a clean, show current theming stuff with rofi (with a selection?)


To Do GLobal:
- Think about better ways to allow for super rapid iteration
  - this would mean something like 1 click viewing of script output (perhaps Typecrafts tmux-vim plugin
  - Alternative is having a way to do quick autocmd for a particular file to say, run X on write, or run script on write/one click. Obv this is already there, but make it super easy
