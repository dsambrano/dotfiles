# Development Decisions

## To Do list:
-[] Switch current aliases folder to be two symlinks, one for global git repo and one for fedora specific (could make them no longer a folder, but I like for organization and for non symlink usage)
-[] Go back and see which have already been tested, and test the unix general ones that way I can be sure the script just works
-[] Install MPV, Anime from terminal, and nVidia Proprietary drivers through RPM Fusions 
-[] Set up some keyboard shortcuts: e.g., Super+B is brave, Super+T terminal 
-[] Install WM (awesome)
-[] Use custom Grub (Much later; create custom grub either purple or vegeta theme)
